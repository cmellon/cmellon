- 👋 Hi, I’m @cmellon
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end and full stack development with .NET and Vue. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET Core, the more complex capabilities of Vue.js + Vuetify, and the wide world of NPM libraries. 
- 💞️ I have experience with SQL (specifically DB2), ASP.NET MVC, Web API, C#, .NET Framework, Vue.js, Vuetify, WinForms, and Infragistics.
I am enthusiastic about UX and specialize in user centered design processes, interaction design, and usability analysis. 
In the pursuit of more experience and personal development I would be open to collaboration or consultation on any of these technologies or practices. 
- 📫 If you're interested in collaborating, I'll be checking this platform quite frequently. Have a brilliant day! o/
